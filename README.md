# Kasra-Cloud-File-Storage
Developed a Django-based cloud storage application that allows users to manage their folders and files. The project includes user authentication, file upload/download functionality, and dynamic folder navigation. Integrated a custom file path handling mechanism to ensure seamless file operations across the application. 

Due to storage limitations on AWS, Kasra Cloud is not designed to handle large files or a significant volume of files; this project is just meant to demonstrate the capabilities of file management on the cloud.
